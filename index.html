                <h2>Preamble</h2>
                <p>Welcome to The Phoenix Coalition. Our mission is to build a better future through innovative policies
                    and inclusive governance. The Phoenix Coalition believes that lasting freedom comes not from
                    constant upheaval, but from rebuilding with discipline, fairness, and purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After prolonged polarization, economic inequality, and loss of trut in leadership, we refuse to
                    choose between
                    disorder and complacency. Instead, we rise from the ashes of past failures to forge a new path
                    forward.
                    We will lead with strength, enforcing law with consistency, protecting the economy, and respecting
                    every citizen's
                    right to live freely in their personal life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe in a government that is firm yet fair, one that upholds the rule of law while ensuring
                    justice and opportunity for all
                    while staying out of personal choics. The role of th government is to keep order, ensure
                    opportunity, and defend liberty; not moralize or divide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will fight corruption wherever it lives, whether in government offices or boardrooms. We will
                    rebuild trust in our institutions, restore dignity to work, and make sure that safety and stability
                    are rights, not privileges.
                </p>
